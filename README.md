# Note Links Citations Plugin

This is a Note Link Citation Plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It converts all internal links to 'Book Search' or 'Web Clipper' pages into a internal note links witha display text of Harvard citations.

* If a has link to a 'Web Clip' of https://github.com/stretchyboy/obsidian-note-link-citation  which looks like `[[obsidian-note-link-citation]]`
* Right Click & * Click 'Note links to citations' (There is also a command for this)
* Will be converted to `[[obsidian-note-link-citation|('Obsidian Note Link Citation')]]` which looks like a Harvard link but still works and will not break if I convert it again.
* If citing a page in a book i.e. (R. T. Dean, 2018, p. 95) the page will be preserved
